## Featured Projects
- **[RISC-V 3-Stage CPU](https://github.com/EnochWong521/riscv-3stage-cpu)**  
  RTL implementation of a 3-stage pipelined RISC-V RV32I CPU core in SystemVerilog, featuring synchronous write + combinational read register file, hazard detection, and forwarding.

- **[Systolic Array Accelerator](https://github.com/EnochWong521/systolic-array-accelerator)**  
  RTL implementation of a systolic array accelerator for matrix multiplication.

- **[Battery Cell Modeling](https://github.com/EnochWong521/battery-cell-modeling)**  
  Analysis of a high-voltage battery cell under 10A load using a first-order Thevenin model. Includes OCV fitting, transient response correction, and estimation of internal resistance and capacitance.

- **[SPI IMU Data Logger](https://github.com/EnochWong521/spi-imu-data-logger)**  
  Firmware for SPI communication with an LSM6DSL IMU to acquire accelerometer and gyroscope data, using interrupts for efficient sampling and UART for real-time visualization.

- **[UART Signal Visualization](https://github.com/EnochWong521/uart-signal-visualization)**  
  Event-driven 12-bit ADC sampling with UART-controlled real-time signal visualization on AVR XMEGA.

- **[Digital Design Learning](https://github.com/EnochWong521/digital-design-learning)**  
  Verilog implementations of digital design modules (ALU, SRAM, decoders, shift registers, counters) with synthesizable RTL and self-checking testbenches.
